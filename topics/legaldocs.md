# Legal document publishing

The BACX team no longer publishes legal documents for products, services, apps, features, and so on. The legal documents are being centralized on the marketing site, rather than on Docs. 

If you are a PM who needs a legal document published, start by filling out 
this request form:
[Legal docs publication request](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_workitems/create/Task)

If you are a writer or content strategist who is asked how to get a legal document published, also refer the person asking to the request form. 

The PMs overseeing the legal doc publishing are Dimpi Gandhi (dimpigan) and John Hart (johhar).
