# Transition to new email

Provide your Microsoft team with your non-Microsoft email alias and make sure that existing meeting requests are forwarded to that new account.

To import the Microsoft mail you saved in a PST file to your new account, see [Import email, contacts, and calendar from an Outlook .pst file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).
