# Work off the network

Vendors can continue to contribute even without network access. 

For those who make the transition from working on the corporate network to working untethered, it can feel like starting over. But the transition can be painless with some planning and support. In order to maintain access to your work, your laptop, and the tools you need to do your job, these are actions you’ll need to take:

- [Back up files, mail, saved links](back-up-files.md)
- [Transition to new email](email-change.md)
- [Request guest access to GitHub repos](github-access.md)
- [Add your non-Microsoft alias to Teams chats](team-chats.md)
- [Request access to restricted sites](access-sites.md)

## Consider what you can’t do

Losing corpnet access means you also lose some functionality. To set expectations, be aware that you won’t be able to:

- See review pages on Docs.
- Merge pull requests.
- Access the release plans planner app.
- Look up names in the Microsoft global address list.
- Be included on group aliases.
