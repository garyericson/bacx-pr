# Feature detail

| Audience | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| Business decision makers | People within an organization that are looking to understand what the investment areas and overview mean for business, how they would be impacted by it, and why they should care. |
| Technical roles | People within an organization that are looking to understand what the feature is and how it will work. |

## Purpose
The **Feature detail** provides the technical aspects of a feature and is the root of the release plans. It is published on the live site. It is the main content of the release plans. It is where the feature is described, and the focus is on important details and technical content. 

## Guidelines
Use the following guidelines when writing the **Feature detail**:

* Be explicit and clear.
* Write directly to the user, using words like "you."
* Use informal, casual, but authoritative language. Use contractions, and spell out abbreviations.
* Be concise, but be precise.
* Use white space; put sentences into individual paragraphs.
* Link to relevant docs using Markdown syntax.
* Use the present tense. For example, "bots can use" instead of "bots will be able to use."
