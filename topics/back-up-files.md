# Back up files, mail, saved links

Prepare for the loss of all your files and mail in your Microsoft account by saving what you need. Once your Microsoft account expires, you won’t be able to sign in to that account, and everything associated with it will be removed from the computer.

Check with your agency to see if or how they manage transitions between accounts on your laptop. 

Make sure you have a [local account](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10-20de74e0-ac7f-3502-a866-32915af2a34d) on your machine, with admin privileges, that you’ll use to sign in after you lose Microsoft access. 

Back up all your files so you can add them to your local account. Keep a list of the important links you want to keep. 

Save your mail by creating a PST file that you can transfer to Outlook on your local account. To create a PST file, see [Export or backup email, contacts, and calendar to an Outlook .pst file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91). To import this data to Outlook on your local account, see [Import email, contacts, and calendar from an Outlook .pst file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

You might need to turn off BitLocker before you lose your Microsoft account. Check with your agency. If you need to turn off BitLocker:

1. Go to Start, type **Manage BitLocker**, and then select it from the list of results. Note: You'll only see this option if BitLocker is available for your device. 
2. Select **Turn off BitLocker** and then follow the instructions.
